        <p>A ski possesses several important features, such as radius, stiffness, and torsional stiffness. These attributes are vital when choosing the skis that suit you best.</p>
        
        <h2>Bindings</h2>
        <p>Bindings consist of a toe and heel piece. In a fall, the toe piece releases sideways and sometimes upwards, while the heel piece releases upward or multi-directionally.Other binding components: Ski brakes: When boots are in the bindings, these prongs line up with the sides of the skis, out of the way.</p>
        
        <h2>Skis for different uses</h2>
        <p>Your choices are all-mountain skis, all-mountain wide skis, freestyle skis, powder skis and backcountry skis. The type of skis you choose will be based on the type of skiing you plan to do.</p>
        
        <h2>Ski type explained</h2>
        <p><strong>The right ski for you.</strong> These <strong>three</strong> things are a must for skis.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Preferred ski length</li>
            <li>How wide the ski is underfoot</li>
            <li>Different ski performances</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Skis with integrated bindings installed are convenient and ensure good <em>performance</em>. However, many intermediate and advanced skiers prefer skis without integrated bindings so they can pick ski bindings that meet their specific needs.</p>
        
        <dl>
            <dt>Camber skis</dt>
            <dd>You can visualize camber as the concave arch the ski makes with the snow. Camber is why most skis don't contact each other under the bindings when you hold them base-to-base.</dd>
            <dt>Rocker skis</dt>
            <dd><a href="https://www.rei.com/learn/expert-advice/ski-rocker-technology.html" target="_blank">Rocker</a>, also referred to as early rise, is the happy medium between a full cambered ski and a reverse camber ski.</dd>
        </dl>
        <p>These tips are for turning on skis</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make a big wide wedge with your skis to come to a quick stop, or a smaller wedge to slow yourself down. When youâ€™re learning to ski, expect some serious outer thigh burn after a full day of plowing down the hill.</li>
            <li>With both skis facing the right, lean your weight into the left hand ski a little and keep turning your skis parallel to the hill until you are facing slightly uphill, where you will come to a complete stop.</li>
            <li>Start skiing downhill. To turn to the right, weight your left ski first and quickly rotate both skis completely to the right, keeping them parallel to each other rather than making a wedge shape.</li>
        </ul>
