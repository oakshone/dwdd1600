        <h1>Tools</h1>
        <p>There are several types of skis out there and its all dependent on how comfortable you feel or want to step up your game.</p>
        
        <h2>Powder skis</h2>
        <p>As the name implies, these skis perform best when skiing deep powder snow. Sometimes called super-fats, powder skis typically have waist widths of 109mm and higher for men's skis and 100mm and higher for women's skis to provide flotation and a surflike, playful feel.Many feature a fully rockered profile or rockered tips and tails to further boost flotation, enhance maneuverability and keep edges from catching. Be aware that they're not built for precise turns on groomed runs, but they are absolutely the best choice for a memorable day when the powder is deep.</p>
        
        <h2>All mountain skis</h2>
        <p>Sometimes called carving skis, all-mountain skis are suited for all age groups and any experience level. Skis with narrow waists up to 85mm are typically considered "front-side skis" and are meant mostly for groomed conditions. All-mountain skis with 85mm-95mm are best for a mix of groomed and powder.</p>
        
        <h2>Park skis</h2>
        <p>Park & pipe skis are essential for ultimate precision on park features and flying in the air, whether you're an Olympic athlete or a budding freestyle skier. Typically, both park and freestyle skis are built lighter to help reduce swing weight and offer more flexibility while pressing into rails or the lip of a jump.</p>
