            <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tyB7Wu_aCq8&ab_channel=StompItTutorials" target="_blank">Steps</a> to take</h2>
            <p>With both skis facing the <strong>right</strong>, lean your weight into the left hand ski a little and keep turning your skis parallel to the hill until you are facing slightly uphill, where you will come to a complete stop. <strong>Naturally</strong>, when you're turning to the left, you'll lean your weight into the right, or downhill, ski.</p>
        
            <h2>Snow Plow</h2>
            <p>Make a big wide wedge with your skis to come to a quick stop, or a smaller wedge to slow yourself down. When you’re learning to ski, expect some serious outer thigh burn after a full day of plowing down the hill.</p>
       
            <h2>Turning</h2>
            <p>With both skis facing the right, lean your weight into the left hand ski a little and keep turning your skis parallel to the hill until you are facing slightly uphill, where you will come to a complete stop. Naturally, when you’re turning to the left, you’ll lean your weight into the right, or downhill, ski.</p>
            
            <h2>The "hockey" stop</h2>
            <p>Start skiing downhill. To turn to the right, weight your left ski first and quickly rotate both skis completely to the right, keeping them parallel to each other rather than making a wedge shape. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIfU38nAYYk&ab_channel=AlpineIceFreestyle" target="_blank">Bend</a> your knees and keep your weight over your left (downhill ski) and keep your skis flat until you stop to maintain your balance. Make sure you turn from your feet and not your upper body</p>
