            <h1>Skiing History</h1>
        
        <h2>Karelia</h2>
            <p>Skiing dates back to <em>6000 BCE</em> in a region in western Russia on the border of Finland. The sport evolved from the beginnings in Scandinavia, starting in the <em>mid-1800's</em> skiing became very popular in snow regions world wide at that time. The word skiing comes from Old Norse word which means "cleft wood" or "stick of wood" or as it is know now by <strong>ski</strong>.</p>

            <h2>Turning and stopping</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Basic athletic stance</li>
                <li>Side-stepping and traversing</li>
                <li>Bull fighter turn</li> 
            </ul>
            <h1>Gear</h1>
            <p>Wicking base layers keep you warm and comfortable by moving sweat away from your skin. Avoid cotton layers at all costs, they do the opposite. Also, be sure to wear one pair of ski or snowboard-specific socks and only one pair.Make sure your snow pants are waterproof, breathable, and appropriate for the climate that you are visiting. And underneath you only want to have on base layers. Mid-layers depend on the weather and your personal preference. Layering is great as the dayâ€™s weather changes, so can your outfit. A little cold put one on, a little warm take one-off.</p>
